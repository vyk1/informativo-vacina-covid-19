The reason this is not typically the approach is because if the vaccine does not work, the manufacturer will have spent a significant amount of money to produce something that needs to be thrown away.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support efforts — While waiting for a vaccine to be ready, many other aspects of vaccine delivery were prepared, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing plans for how to distribute the first, limited quantities available</li>\n<li>Ensuring adequate supplies for distributing and administering vaccine, like vaccine vials, syringes and other equipment needed to vaccinate</li>\n<li>Establishing mechanisms for distribution to large subsets of the population, especially in countries in which mechanisms may not currently be in place. For example, many countries do not have standard programs for vaccinating older adults. So, planning how to reach those people, without unintentionally exposing them to a crowd in which the virus may be spread, was something that could be planned during vaccine development.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"}},"context":{}}
